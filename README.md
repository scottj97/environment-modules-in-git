# Environment Modules in Git

## What?

This is a demonstration of how to version control the Modulefiles
from [Environment Modules](http://modules.sourceforge.net/) using
[Git](https://git-scm.com/).

The Modules concept is a great way to manage versions of tools on a
common server, but managing the Modulefiles themselves is error-prone
when not controlled using a SCM like Git.

## How?

TBD.
